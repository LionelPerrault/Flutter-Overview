/// [Navigator]'s observer to perform [Hero] animations.
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [Scaffold], which provides standard app elements like an [AppBar] and a [Drawer].
///  * [Navigator], which is used to manage the app's stack of pages.
///  * [MaterialPageRoute], which defines an app page that transitions in a material-specific way.
///  * [WidgetsApp], which defines the basic app elements but does not depend on the material library.
