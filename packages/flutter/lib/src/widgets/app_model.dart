/// AppModel is not intended to be a substitute for Provider or any of
/// the other general purpose application state systems. AppModel is
/// for situations where a package's custom widgets need to share one
/// or a handful of immutable data objects that can be lazily
/// initialized. It exists so that packages like that can deliver
/// custom widgets without requiring the developer to add a
/// package-specific umbrella widget to their application.
///
/// A good way to create an AppModel key that avoids potential
/// collisions with other packages is to use a static `Object()` value.
/// The `SharedObject` example below does this.

/// The following sample demonstrates using the automatically created

/// 'foo', and 'bar', and those changes only cause the widgets that
