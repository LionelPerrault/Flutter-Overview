# Until there are meta linter rules, each desired lint must be explicitly enabled.

# This file contains the analysis options used by "flutter analyze" and the
# dartanalyzer when analyzing code outside the flutter repository. It isn't named
# 'analysis_options.yaml' because otherwise editors would use it when analyzing
# the flutter tool itself.
#
# When editing, keep in mind that this is imported by analysis_options.yaml.
# This file is meant to be a less strict subset of rules appropriate for most
# Flutter projects, but does not contain all of the lints that are used by the
# core Flutter repositories.

  errors:
    # treat missing required parameters as a warning (not a hint)

    # these rules are documented on and in the same order as
