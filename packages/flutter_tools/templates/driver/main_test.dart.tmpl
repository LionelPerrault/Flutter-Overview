// This is a basic Flutter Driver test for the application. A Flutter Driver
// test is an end-to-end test that "drives" your application from another
// process or even from another computer. If you are familiar with
// Selenium/WebDriver for web, Espresso for Android or UI Automation for iOS,
// this is simply Flutter's version of that.
//
// To start the test run the following command from the root of your application
// package:
//
//     flutter drive --target=test_driver/main_test.dart

import 'package:flutter_driver/flutter_driver.dart';

    setUpAll(() async {
      // Connect to a running Flutter application instance.
      driver = await FlutterDriver.connect();
    });

    tearDownAll(() async {
      if (driver != null)
        driver.close();
    });

    test('tap on the floating action button; verify counter', () async {
      // Find floating action button (fab) to tap on
      ObjectRef fab = await driver.findByTooltipMessage('Increment');
