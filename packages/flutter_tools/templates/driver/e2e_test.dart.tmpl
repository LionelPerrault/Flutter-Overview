// This is a basic Flutter Driver test for the application. A Flutter Driver
// test is an end-to-end test that "drives" your application from another
// process or even from another computer. If you are familiar with
// Selenium/WebDriver for web, Espresso for Android or UI Automation for iOS,
// this is simply Flutter's version of that.
//
// To start the test run the following command from the root of your application
// package:
//
//     flutter drive --target=test_driver/e2e.dart
//
import 'package:flutter_driver/flutter_driver.dart';
import 'package:test/test.dart';

main() {
  group('end-to-end test', () {
    FlutterDriver driver;

    setUpAll(() async {
      // Connect to a running Flutter application instance.
      driver = await FlutterDriver.connect();
    });

    tearDownAll(() async {
      if (driver != null) driver.close();
    });

    test('find the floating action button by value key', () async {
      ObjectRef elem = await driver.findByValueKey('fab');
      expect(elem, isNotNull);
      expect(elem.objectReferenceKey, isNotNull);
    });

    test('tap on the floating action button; verify counter', () async {
      ObjectRef fab = await driver.findByValueKey('fab');
      expect(fab, isNotNull);
      await driver.tap(fab);
      ObjectRef counter = await driver.findByValueKey('counter');
      expect(counter, isNotNull);
      String text = await driver.getText(counter);
      expect(text, contains("Button tapped 1 times."));
    });
  });
