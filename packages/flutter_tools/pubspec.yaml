# A note about 'test':
# We depend on very specific internal implementation details of the
# 'test' package, which change between versions, so here we pin it
# precisely. This is also pinned in the 'flutter' package.
# See also https://github.com/dart-lang/test/pull/320

# A note about 'analyzer':
# We don't actually depend on 'analyzer', but 'test' does. We aren't
# compatible with some older versions of 'analyzer'. We lie here,
# saying we do depend on it, so that we constrain the version that
# 'test' will get to a version that we'll probably be ok with. (This
# is why there's no upper bound on our dependency.)
